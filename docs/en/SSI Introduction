Introduction to SSI
-------------------

**Definition**

Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) refers to a digital identity model that gives individuals total control and ownership over their personal data.
Users will hold the digital documents of their identity, will control to which actors they will share those documents and also have the ability to revoke the use of those documents - all of this along with activity history.
    
**What it is useful for**

A secure Self-Sovereign Identity Wallet is essential because it allows people to carry their credentials anywhere on their digital devices. Portability is one of the principles of SSI.

Other key elements that characterize an SSI system include:
 - Privacy and control: SSI enables individuals to maintain control over their personal data. They can choose what information to share, with whom and for what purpose. This reduces the risk of personal data being collected, stored or misused by centralized entities;
 - Security: SSI leverages advanced cryptographic techniques to ensure the integrity and security of identity information. It reduces the risk of identity theft, fraud and unauthorized access, as the data remains in the individual's control and is not stored in a single vulnerable location;
 - Interoperability: SSI promotes interoperability by enabling different systems and organizations to recognize and verify identities without relying on a central authority. This allows for seamless and trusted interactions between individuals, organizations and even across borders;
 - Efficiency and cost reduction: individuals can manage their own identities with SSI, eliminating the need for multiple identity credentials and repetitive identity verification processes. This can streamline administrative processes, reduce costs and enhance user experience.
    
**Example**

An example of SSI in action could be a scenario where an individual needs to prove their age to access a restricted service, such as purchasing age-restricted items. Instead of presenting physical identification documents or disclosing their full birthdate, the individual can use their SSI system. They would share only the necessary information, such as a digitally signed proof of being above the legal age, without revealing any other personal details. The verifier can then cryptographically validate the proof without needing to rely on a centralized authority or store the individual's personal information.
