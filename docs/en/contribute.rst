How to contribute
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The IT Wallet project and, therefore, the present document are inspired by an **“open” spirit**. This means that the development is meant to be accessible by anyone and all interested parties are invited to join the process.

Hence, stakeholders and members of the national and international community are encouraged, and more than welcome, to contribute to the content and editing of these technical rules.

Here are some tools that you can use to submit your contribution:

- **Pull requests**. PRs let you tell others about changes you have pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch;
- **GitHub issues**. Issues let you track your work on GitHub, where development happens. When you mention an issue in another issue or pull request, the issue’s timeline reflects the cross-reference so that you can keep track of related work. To indicate that work is in progress, you can link an issue to a pull request. When the pull request merges, the linked issue automatically closes;
- **Developers Italia Slack channel**. Slack is a messaging app for business that connects people to the information they need. *Developers Italia* is an open community based on the participation and contribution of public administrations, developers, technicians, students and citizens. *Developers Italia* started a Slack channel that everyone can join for free, where you can discover all their activities and participate in the discussion.
