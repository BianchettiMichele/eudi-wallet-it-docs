How to contribute
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The IT Wallet project and, therefore, the present document are inspired by an **“open” spirit**. This means that the development is meant to be accessible by anyone and all interested parties are invited to join the process.

Hence, stakeholders and members of the national and international community are encouraged, and more than welcome, to contribute to the content of these technical rules.

Below are listed the ways that can be used to give contributions to this project:

- **GitHub issues**. By opening an issue it is possible to ask clarifications, propose enhancements or notify editorial typos. To indicate that work is in progress is possible to link an issue to a pull request;
- **Pull requests**. These represents active contributions to the project, where a discussion in the form of issues has already taken place. Once a pull request is opened, some discussions and reviews of the proposed changes take place, before the changes are merged into the main branch (`versione-corrente`);
- **Developers Italia Slack channel**. Slack is a messaging app for business that connects people to the information they need. *Developers Italia* is an open community based on the participation and contribution of public administrations, developers, technicians, students and citizens. *Developers Italia* started a Slack channel that [everyone can join for free](https://slack.developers.italia.it/), where you can discover all their activities and participate in the discussion.
