Introduction to SSI
-------------------

**Definition**

Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) refers to a new paradigm in Identity and Access Management (IAM). It consists of a digital identity model that, differently from existing identity management ecosystems, gives individuals total control and ownership over their personal data.
Users hold their digital documents, control to which actors they present those documents and also have the ability to revoke the use of those documents, all of this along with activity history.

SSI is also significant in the field of data exchange or data governance. This is relevant both at the national and European levels, including the new eIDAS Regulation. Indeed, it envisages a login option intended for European Users - be them citizens, public administrations and companies - who want to access another Member State's services using their national authentication systems.

The main roles in an SSI ecosystem are, therefore, as follows:
 - Issuers: parties who can issue attributes or "credentials" about a person;
 - Verifiers: parties who request Holders' attributes as they want to know something about them;
 - Holders: individuals who own a Wallet and have control over the attributes that they can acquire, store and present to Verifiers;
 - Verifiable Data Registries: Authorities that publishes certificates, attestation, metadata and schemes needed for trust establishment between the parties.

**What it is useful for**

In the SSI model, the data source (e.g., an educational insitution) gives credentials to the User, who can store them in their digital Wallet.
A secure Self-Sovereign Identity Wallet is essential because it allows people to carry their credentials anywhere on their digital devices. Indeed, the Wallet usually comes in the form of an application on the User's mobile phone. Portability is hence one of the principles of SSI.

Other key elements that characterize an SSI system include:
 - Privacy and control: SSI enables individuals to maintain control over their personal data. They can choose what information to release, with whom and for what purpose. This reduces the risk of personal data being collected, stored or misused;
 - Security: SSI leverages advanced cryptographic techniques to ensure the integrity and security of identity information. It avoids the risk of identity theft, fraud and unauthorized access, as the data remain in the individual's control and is not stored in a single vulnerable location;
 - Interoperability: SSI promotes interoperability by enabling different systems and organizations to recognize and verify identities without relying on a central authority. This allows for seamless and trusted interactions between individuals, organizations and even across borders;
 - Efficiency and cost reduction: individuals can manage their own identities with SSI, eliminating the need for multiple identity credentials and repetitive identity verification processes. This can streamline administrative processes, reduce costs and enhance user experience.
    
**Example**

When a User wants to purchase a service, the service provider asks the User for a certain proof. Instead of presenting physical identification documents or disclosing their full data, the individual can use their SSI system.
An example of SSI in action could be a scenario where an individual needs to prove their age to access a restricted service, such as purchasing age-restricted items. They would release only the necessary information, such as a digitally signed proof of being above the legal age, without revealing any other personal details.
The verifier can then cryptographically validate the proof.
